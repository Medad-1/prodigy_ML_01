# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The goal is to provide a predictive tool that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It contains various features related to house characteristics and their corresponding sale prices.
